## Description:
IITB-CPU is a 16-bit very simple computer developed for the teaching that is based on the Little Computer Architecture. The IITB-CPU is an 8-register, 16-bit computer system. It has 8 general-purpose registers (R0 to R7). Register R7 is always stores Program Counter. PC points to the next instruction. This architecture uses condition code register which has two flags Carry flag (c) and Zero flag (z). The IITB-CPU is very simple, but it is general enough to solve complex problems. There are three machine-code instruction formats (R, I, and J type) and a total of 14 instructions.
